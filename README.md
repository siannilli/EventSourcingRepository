# EventSourcingRepository

This repo contains a preliminary design for a CQRS + Event Source implementation of spot charter management.
The source code targets .NET framework 4.5. 

This repository is stale and the code has been ported to the new repository [EventSourceShipping](https://github.com/siannilli/EventSourceShipping) that target .NET core and ASP.NET core.
